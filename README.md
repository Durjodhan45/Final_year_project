**Deep Learning Project: Abnormal Heartbeat Classification Using ECG Data**

**Description:**
- Developed a deep learning model to classify abnormal heartbeats from ECG data to assist in early diagnosis of cardiac conditions.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

**Methods and Techniques:**
- Implemented a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units to analyze sequential ECG data.
- Applied data preprocessing techniques including normalization and noise reduction.

**Dataset:**
- Utilized the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset, consisting of annotated ECG recordings.
- Dataset Link:-https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat?resource=download

**Results and Performance:**
- Achieved an accuracy of 95% and an F1 score of 0.93 in classifying abnormal heartbeats.
- Improved model performance by 10% through hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation.

**Role and Responsibilities:**
- Sole developer responsible for model design, implementation, and evaluation.
- Conducted extensive literature review to inform model architecture and preprocessing techniques.

**Challenges and Solutions:**
- Overcame imbalanced dataset issues using oversampling and class weighting techniques.
